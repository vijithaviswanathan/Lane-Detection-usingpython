## Conclusion:

Lane detection is a crucial component of autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to understand their position relative to the road. This project demonstrates the application of fundamental computer vision techniques to achieve real-time lane detection using Python. By leveraging edge detection, color filtering, and the Hough transform, we can robustly identify lane markings under varying conditions.

Through this project, we have explored:

1.Edge Detection: Using the Canny edge detector to identify potential lane edges.

2.Region of Interest (ROI) Selection: Focusing only on relevant parts of the image for lane detection.

3.Line Detection: Utilizing the Hough transform to convert detected edges into lane lines.

The implementation provides a foundational understanding of how computer vision algorithms can be applied to solve real-world problems in autonomous driving. Future enhancements could include advanced techniques like lane curvature detection, adaptive parameter tuning based on environmental conditions, and integration with higher-level decision-making algorithms for autonomous vehicles.
